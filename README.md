# filter-adc-microcontroller
This project intent to show you defensive programming skills in embedded C programs. I hope you find helpfully. 


# Description

This code is for read the ADC channel, the code was build for ATmega8 device, some concepts I want to show in this example.

Here are some topics about this projects:
1. Read the ADC Channel
2. Applying digital filter to signal for reduce noise.
3. Applying good defensive programming techniques.

The main signal comes from resistor divisor and photo transistor.

If you have any question please feel free to contact me.
